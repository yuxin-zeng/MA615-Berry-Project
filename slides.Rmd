## Introduction
The NASS website has a large amount of berries data from many states in recent years, but these data are very messy, with mixed variables and different dimensions. After some simple cleaning and organization, I chose blueberry for EDA and present it in a shiny app.

## Data Peparation
- Remove meaningless columns
- Filter berries
- Organize the columns 

## Remove meaningless columns
The berries data had only 8 out of 21 columns containing meaningful data.

## Filter berries
- Period:
  Since the definition of "Marketing year" varies by commodity, we only consider the "Year" period.
  
- Value:
  D, withheld to avoid disclosing data for individual operations.
  NA, not available.

- Commodity:
  Divide the berries data into blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries. My EDA is based on blueberries.

## Organize the columns 
Separate multiple variables from the same column, merge variables of the same type into a new column, and delete duplicate columns. Organize columns containing variables that are not properly separated. Rename and joint all the columns in blueberries.
```{r}
berries=read_csv("berries.csv",col_names=T)
head(berries$`Data Item`,n=3)
```
